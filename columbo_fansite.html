      <h2 id="about_columbo">About Columbo</h2>
      <p style="color:darkred">Columbo is an American crime drama television series starring Peter Falk as
        Lieutenant Columbo,
        a homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. After two pilot episodes in 1968 and 1971,
        the show originally aired on NBC from 1971 to 1978 as one of the rotating programs of The NBC Mystery Movie.
        Columbo then aired less frequently on ABC from 1989 to 2003.</p>
      <p>Columbo is a shrewd and intelligent blue-collar homicide detective whose trademarks include his rumpled beige
        raincoat, unassuming demeanor, cigar, old Peugeot 403 car, love of chili con carne, and unseen wife (whom
        he mentions frequently). He often leaves a room only to return with the catchphrase "Just one more thing" to ask
        a
        critical question.</p>
      <p>The character and show, created by Richard Levinson and William Link, popularized the inverted detective story
        format (sometimes referred to as a "howcatchem"). This genre begins by showing the commission of the crime and
        its
        perpetrator; the plot therefore usually has no "whodunit" element of determining which of several suspects
        committed the crime. It instead revolves around how a perpetrator known to the audience will finally be caught
        and
        exposed.</p>

      <p>He applied for a job with the CIA, but he was rejected because of his membership in the Marine Cooks and
        Stewards
        Union while serving in the Merchant Marine, even though he was required to join and was not active in the union
        (which had been under fire for communist leanings). He then became a management analyst with the Connecticut
        State
        Budget Bureau in Hartford.</p>
      <p>In 1997, Falk characterized his Hartford job as efficiency expert: <q>I was such an efficiency expert that the
          first morning on the job, I couldn't find the building where I was to report for work. Naturally, I was late,
          which I always was in those days, but ironically it was my tendency never to be on time that got me started as
          a
          professional actor.</q> It wasn't until 1968 until he would begin 35 year journey as everyone's favorite
        rumpled
        detective.</p>
